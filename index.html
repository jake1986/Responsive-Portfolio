        <h1>About Me</h1>

      <img class="img-responsive me" src="../Responsive-Portfolio/assets/images/About Me Photo copy.jpg" alt="Jake Smiling">

      <p>My name is Jake Rhoads. I have been a middle school Spanish teacher for the past 3 years, however I have
        decided to leave that career path to pursue something in the technology field. I love to learn languages. Beyond
        Spanish, I speak Portuguese and I am learning Italian. I decided to learn Portuguese because it is so similar to
        Spanish. I also had a brief stay in Brazil where I taught English and continued to improve my Portuguese. I love
        to travel, play sports, exercise, play music -- guitar and cavaquinho -- when I make time, and learning
        languages. I want to learn how to create programs that can improve our ability to learn languages, such as
        websites such as Ba Ba Dum, etc. Some of the language apps that I have used are helpful but they are not as
        engaging as I would like them to be.</p>

      <p> I have a brother named Daniel who lives in Spain with his wife Silvia. They live in the city of Barcelona.
        Silvia is Italian and is from Rome. That is one of the reasons why I decided to learn Italian. My brother is
        becoming very proficient in Italian and I would like to be able to acquire the same skill. We really enjoy to
        spend time together. During the summer of 2019 I stayed in Spain for 2 months and Dan, Silvia, and I traveled to
        Germany together for 9 days. We visited Munich and Berlin. It was an unforgettable experience for all 3 of us.
        Hopefully after the coding bootcamp, I will do something with them as far as travelling again together. It is
        very easy for us to all travel together because we get along so well. Also, my brother and I were exposed to
        travel at an early age and that helped us become comfortable being around and immersed in foreign cultures. </p>
